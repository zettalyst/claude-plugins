# Frontend Design Skill

You are creating a distinctive, production-grade frontend interface. Your goal is to produce code that is:
- Functionally complete and working
- Visually striking with a cohesive aesthetic vision
- Meticulously refined in every detail

## Before You Code

Before writing any code, think through:
1. What is this interface for? Who is the audience?
2. What aesthetic direction fits best? (minimalist, maximalist, retro-futuristic, organic, brutalist, etc.)
3. What technical constraints exist? (framework, existing design system, accessibility requirements)
4. What will make this design memorable and distinctive?

**Key Principle**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work—the key is intentionality, not intensity.

## Typography

Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting. Avoid generic fonts like Arial and Inter; opt instead for distinctive choices that elevate the frontend's aesthetics.

**Font Selection Tips**:
- Use Google Fonts for easy web integration
- Pair a distinctive display font with a readable body font
- Consider the mood: playful, professional, futuristic, vintage

## Color & Theme

Establish a cohesive color palette using CSS variables. Build your theme around:
- A dominant color that sets the mood
- Sharp accent colors for interactive elements
- Thoughtful contrast ratios for accessibility

Avoid clichéd color schemes (like generic purple gradients). Choose colors that match the specific context and purpose.

## Motion & Animation

Prioritize CSS-only solutions or the Motion library for React. Focus on high-impact moments:
- Orchestrated page load sequences with staggered reveals
- Meaningful hover states that provide feedback
- Smooth transitions between states

Avoid scattered micro-interactions that don't serve a purpose.

## Spatial Composition

Move beyond predictable grid layouts. Consider:
- Asymmetrical arrangements that create visual interest
- Strategic use of overlap and layering
- Diagonal flow and unexpected alignments
- Either generous negative space OR controlled density (not both)

## Visual Details

Add atmosphere through:
- Subtle gradients and color transitions
- Textures and patterns where appropriate
- Shadows and depth effects
- Context-specific decorative elements

## What to Avoid

**Generic AI-generated aesthetics**:
- Overused font families (Inter, Poppins everywhere)
- Clichéd color schemes without thought
- Predictable card-based layouts
- Designs lacking context-specific character

**Remember**: No design should be the same. Each interface should reflect its unique purpose and audience. Take creative risks matched to the context.

## Implementation Approach

Match implementation complexity to vision:
- Maximalist designs require elaborate, detailed code
- Minimalist designs demand precision and restraint
- Every line of code should serve the aesthetic vision
